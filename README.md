# Python REST APIs With Flask,Connexion, and SQLALchemy
---
This is a three part tutorial series to build a REST API with the **Flask web framework**. Foundation is created with a basic Flask project then endpoints are added and connected them to a **SQLite database**. I will test my API with **Swagger UI API documantation** that I'll build along the way.

## First part
---
In the first part of the project, the process will cover how to:
* Build a base **Flask** project with a **REST API**
* Handle **HTTP requests** with **Connexion**
* Define **API endpoints** using the **OenAPI** specification
* Interact with your **API** to manage data
* Build **API documantation** with **Swagger UI**
